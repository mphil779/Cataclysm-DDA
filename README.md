# Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead

Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead is a roguelike set in a post-apocalyptic world. While some have described it as a "zombie game", there is far more to Cataclysm than that. Struggle to survive in a harsh, persistent, procedurally generated world. Scavenge the remnants of a dead civilization for food, equipment, or, if you are lucky, a vehicle with a full tank of gas to get you the hell out of Dodge. Fight to defeat or escape from a wide variety of powerful monstrosities, from zombies to giant insects to killer robots and things far stranger and deadlier, and against the others like yourself, that want what you have...

# NOTE: This is a modified version of Cataclysm DDA 0.D.

Anyone that uses this altered version of the game is also using some modifications that I've made. There is a risk that the game might run different than expected or that I've most likely broken some things (or everything) in the process of messing around with the code.
